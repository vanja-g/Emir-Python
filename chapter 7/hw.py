"""The user enters a collection of any amount of numbers
We need to print each of these numbers using tens notation
for example -> User enters 32,1456, 150
Output:
'32 = 3*10 + 2*1'
'1456 = 1 * 1000 + 4*100 + 5*10 + 6*1'
'150 = 1*100 + 5*10 + 0*1'

Hint: For each of the numbers, go thorough each of its digits,
    Figure out which power of 10 to start with and accumulate to the string,
     decreasing power of 10 bz one every time
