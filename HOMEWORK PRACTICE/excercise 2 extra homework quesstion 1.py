#step 1: take the list with duplicates and make it a dictionary
# fromkeys makes a dictionary with a specific value and specified keys
#step 2: make it back into a list, when u make it back into a list it removes the duplicates
#because it makes all the items as keys all the duplicates disapear and become a value
#and when u print it, dictionaries cant have duplicate keys so u get no duplicates
