loops:
    definite loop:
            a loop which i know how many times it will run. These are "for" loops.

                for i in range(10):
                    ...
                this loop will run 10 times and "i" will become each number between 0 and 10
                not including 10

                for i in <collection>:
                    ...
                this loop is running through a collection of something. It will run however
                long this collection is. "i" will become each element in the collection.

    indefinite loop:
            a loop which I dont know how many times it will run. These are "while" loops.
                while <condition> :
                    ...
                condition is code that evaluates to true or false.




maps(dictionary):
    a collection of key-value pairs.
    d = {"k":1,"l":2, ...}
    adding to a dictionary:
        d["m"] = 3
    accessing values:
        print(d["l"]) => 2
    size of dictionary:
        len(d)
    how to get list of all keys in dictionary:
        l = d.keys()
    how to get list of all values in dictionary:
        l = d.values()
    how to get list of all keys-value pairs at once:
        l = d.items()
    removing item from dictionary:
        d.pop("k")



Functions:

    <optional return statement>
